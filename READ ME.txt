How it Works:

You should have a number of Instagram accounts with their username and password in an excel spread sheet.
Example: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m2s48ET7pRIimkL1FUR11n2cAXzWbEGkU6WMWLwNBnY/edit?usp=sharing

You can use the Example above is a template. Once you run the code, the bot will ask for the path on your computer of that spread sheet.
It will ask for the link of the comment you want to send likes to on Instagram (Right click on the comment heart)
Then it will ask how many likes you want to send. Number of likes are based on how many accounts are in your spread sheet.
It will then log in to the accounts provided, like the comment, log out and repeat.
